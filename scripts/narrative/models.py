    Set ``tool`` to the draw-tool button (e.g. ``css:.mapbox-gl-draw_polygon``) and

    This is the half of the late-binding contract that runs ON CAMERA: a demo
    can mint an entity during recording (click "Create", which navigates to
    ``/solicitations/207/``), ``capture`` reads the new id off the resulting
    page, and every scene/action AFTER this one resolves ``${solicitation_id}``
    to ``207``. No fixed IDs, no per-render state resets — each render mints a
    fresh entity and threads its real id forward. (Contrast ``setup.outputs``,
    which only knows ids minted BEFORE the render starts.)

    ``var`` is the variable name to bind (a Python identifier — the same syntax
    ``${var}`` substitution uses). The captured value overrides nothing from
    ``setup.outputs`` unless the names collide, in which case the captured value
    wins (and the recorder warns) — the on-camera value is the fresher truth.

    Two sources:

    - ``source: url`` (default) — read the current page URL. ``pattern`` is a
      REQUIRED regex whose capture group 1 is the value (e.g.
      ``'/solicitations/(\\d+)/'`` against ``/solicitations/207/`` binds ``207``).
    - ``source: element`` — read from a DOM node. ``target`` resolves the node
      (same prefix syntax as ``click``: ``css:``/``testid:``/``text:``/…).
      ``attr`` names an attribute to read (e.g. ``href``); omit ``attr`` to read
      the element's text. ``pattern`` is OPTIONAL here — when given, group 1 is
      extracted from the attr/text; when omitted, the whole trimmed attr/text is
      the value.

    The captured value is always trimmed. If nothing is captured (URL/attr/text
    absent, ``pattern`` has no group, or the regex doesn't match) the capture
    FAILS. ``must_succeed`` (inherited, but defaulting to ``True`` for capture —
    see the recorder) decides whether a failed capture aborts the render: a
