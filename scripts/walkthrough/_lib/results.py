"""Action results + run report for the walkthrough recorder.

Before this module the recorder swallowed failures: a missing click target
printed a warning, the video showed a cursor twitching in place, and the run
reported success. The microplans-10-wards recording shipped at ``Created 0 of
10 plans · 10 errors`` looking fine from the outside until someone checked
plan counts on labs.

Now every action returns an :class:`ActionResult`. The orchestrator
accumulates them in a :class:`RunReport` and prints a per-scene + per-run
summary so silent failures stop hiding. Specs can also set
``must_succeed: true`` on an action; the runner raises instead of swallowing,
turning the recording into a quasi-test.

Error kinds (the ``error_kind`` field) are tagged so a downstream grader can
distinguish "target not found" (a spec drift bug — the UI changed) from
"playwright timeout" (a flaky page) from "unknown_kind" (a spec uses a verb
this recorder doesn't know).
