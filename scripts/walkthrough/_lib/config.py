"""Timing configuration for the walkthrough recorder.

Before this module the recorder's pacing was a constellation of magic numbers
scattered across the primitives — a 250ms here, a 900ms there, a 45ms typing
delay in three different places. Spec authors who wanted a faster-typing demo
or a longer post-click settle had no knob to turn; you had to fork the lib.

Now a single :class:`RecorderConfig` dataclass owns every timing constant. Three
presets — ``fast``, ``medium`` (default), ``slow`` — cover the common video
pacing choices. A spec can override any subset of fields via
``video_recorder_config: { typing_delay_ms: 20 }`` in the YAML.

Two layers of knobs:

- **Scene-level** (``initial_hold_ms``, ``final_hold_ms``, ``min_hold_ms``,
  ``scroll_speed_px_s``) — consumed by the orchestrator between actions.
- **Action-level** (``typing_delay_ms``, ``pre_click_dwell_ms``,
  ``post_click_settle_ms``, …) — consumed by individual primitives.

A primitive that wants to tune its own pacing reads from ``self.config`` (or
the ``config=`` kwarg). A primitive that takes ``config=None`` defaults to
:class:`RecorderConfig` (medium pace) so existing call sites keep working.

THE TIMING MODEL — one map, so the next person doesn't do archaeology
======================================================================

The authoritative author-facing doc is the **"Recording time & dead space"**
section of ``plugins/canopy/skills/walkthrough/SKILL.md``. Code-side summary:

**Off camera** (never films): the spec's ``setup:`` command (runs before any
browser opens) and the ``prewarm`` pass (a separate non-recorded context that
visits each unique scene URL to heat cold caches — ``UnifiedSpec.prewarm`` /
``--prewarm``, knobs ``prewarm_settle_ms`` + ``prewarm_page_timeout_ms``).

**On camera** (every millisecond is film): scene navigation + ``goto_settle_ms``,
``initial_hold_ms``, every action's glide/dwell/settle, ``wait_for`` polling
time, ``hold`` actions, and the end-of-scene final hold.

**Dwell hierarchy** (which knob holds a frame, in precedence order):

1. ``hold`` actions — explicit mid-scene dwells; the recommended way to let a
   viewer sit with a moment (placed exactly where the moment is).
2. ``scene.video_hold_seconds`` — legacy per-scene override of the
   end-of-scene hold (replaces ``final_hold_ms`` for that scene only).
3. ``final_hold_ms`` — the global end-of-scene floor, from the pace preset /
   ``video_recorder_config``.

**Dead-space eliminations** (automatic): a leading ``wait_for`` skips both
``goto_settle_ms`` and ``initial_hold_ms`` (the wait IS the settle); a no-nav
scene skips ``initial_hold_ms``; redundant leading ``goto`` actions are
stripped; ``--skip-empty-scenes`` drops action-less scenes from the film;
``--skip-same-url`` skips re-navs; ``crossfade`` hides the nav white-flash.

**Accounting-only / dead knobs**: ``min_hold_ms`` only floors the REPORTED
per-scene seconds (the "~Ns of footage" total) — it does not pad the film.
``scroll_speed_px_s`` is retained for back-compat but unconsumed since the
static-scene scroll-pan fallback was removed (the ``scroll`` action's eased
scroll has its own internal duration cap).

# Scene pace — teach vs flow (per-scene tempo, orthogonal to video_pace)
# ===========================================================================
#
# ``video_pace`` (fast | medium | slow) is the WHOLE video's tempo — it picks a
# RecorderConfig preset. ``Scene.pace`` (teach | flow) is a PER-SCENE modifier
# layered on top of whatever preset is in force, so an author can mark which
# individual beats need full read-time and which are just connective tissue:
#
#   • teach  — explain the mechanic. Full read-time pacing: the viewer is
#              meeting this UI / concept for the first time, so holds, settles,
#              and a deliberate cursor glide all matter. This is the DEFAULT and
#              is byte-for-byte the pre-existing behavior — a scene with no
#              ``pace:`` field is a teach scene.
#
#   • flow   — the feature is already established; this beat just shows
#              CONTINUITY (navigate there, glance, move on). Compress it:
#              clamp the blind holds to a small ceiling, drop the post-nav
#              settle dwell, and move the cursor faster. Pair with terse or no
#              VO — a flow scene is a transition, not a lesson.
#
# Only ``flow`` transforms the config; ``teach`` / ``None`` / unknown return the
# config unchanged (fully backward-compatible). The transform is a pure function
# (:func:`apply_scene_pace`) so it's unit-testable without a browser.

#: The ceiling (ms) every blind hold is clamped to in a ``flow`` scene —
#: ``initial_hold_ms``, ``final_hold_ms``, ``goto_settle_ms``, the per-primitive
#: ``post_*_settle`` dwells, and an explicit ``hold`` action's duration (see
#: ``HOLD_ACTION_FLOW_CEILING_MS``). 600ms is long enough that a frame doesn't
#: read as a jump-cut but short enough to feel like brisk forward motion. Holds
#: already SHORTER than this (a fast-preset 400ms settle) are left alone — flow
#: only ever clamps DOWN, never pads up.
FLOW_HOLD_CEILING_MS: int = 600

#: ``goto_settle_ms`` is dropped to this in a flow scene — a flow beat doesn't
#: need the post-navigation dwell to let a first-time viewer orient; the
#: crossfade already hides the nav flash, so cut almost all of it.
FLOW_GOTO_SETTLE_MS: int = 200

#: Explicit ``hold`` actions in a flow scene are clamped to this ceiling. An
#: author who dropped a ``hold 4`` in a beat they later mark ``flow`` shouldn't
#: get a 4s freeze in a connective scene — but a hold is still an INTENTIONAL
#: dwell, so flow keeps a touch more than the generic ``FLOW_HOLD_CEILING_MS``.
HOLD_ACTION_FLOW_CEILING_MS: int = 700

#: Cursor travel speed multiplier for a flow scene. ``slow_move`` animates the
#: glide one mouse-move step at a time, so FEWER steps == a FASTER-reading
#: cursor. 1.8x means ``cursor_steps`` (and the short re-centre count) are
#: divided by 1.8 (floored at a small minimum so the glide still animates rather
#: than teleports). Within the requested 1.6–2x band.
FLOW_CURSOR_SPEEDUP: float = 1.8

#: Floor on the divided cursor-step counts — below this the glide reads as a
#: teleport (a jump-cut) instead of fast travel. Keeps flow brisk, not janky.
