"""Target resolution — a thin author-facing layer over Playwright locators.

The walkthrough recorder needs to turn the spec author's free-form ``target``
string ("Resolved wards", "#cfg-strategy", "testid:plan-picker") into something
the cursor can glide to and the verb can act on. Two questions matter:

  1. **Where is the element?**
  2. **How do we click / fill / read its box?**

Playwright already answers both, well: ``Locator`` is the source of truth,
``get_by_role / get_by_text / get_by_label / get_by_test_id / get_by_placeholder``
are the recommended idioms (they use the browser's accessibility tree and
auto-wait for visibility + actionability), and ``Locator.bounding_box()``
gives us coordinates for the synthetic cursor. This module is the adapter
between our author syntax and those APIs — nothing more.

What changed vs the original 0.2.141 implementation: ``_box_center`` ran a
hand-rolled DOM scan ranked actionable-vs-text and ``_glide_to`` polled it
every 150ms until a deadline. Both were partial reimplementations of what
Playwright's locator engine already does — and they bypassed the
``Locator.click()`` actionability checks (visible, stable, receives events,
not detached) by clicking at coordinates. The result was a less-reliable
clone of a thing Playwright already provides correctly.

Now:

  - Each prefix maps directly to a Playwright ``get_by_*`` call:
        ``css:#x``        → ``page.locator("#x")``
        ``testid:foo``    → ``page.get_by_test_id("foo")``
        ``aria:Foo``      → ``page.get_by_label("Foo", exact=False)``
        ``role:button``   → ``page.get_by_role("button")``
        ``role:button:Sign in`` → ``page.get_by_role("button", name="Sign in", exact=True)``
        ``text:Foo``      → ``page.get_by_text("Foo")``
  - Bare targets use a heuristic: CSS-shaped → ``page.locator(...)``; English
    → a small role-prefers-actionable cascade ending in ``get_by_text``.
  - Auto-wait for visibility uses ``Locator.wait_for(state="visible", ...)``
    — the same call Playwright tests use.
  - ``resolve_target`` returns the ``Locator`` itself; primitives that need
    Playwright API surface (``locator.click()``, ``locator.fill()``,
    ``locator.select_option()``) get it directly. The cursor-coordinate box
    comes from ``locator.bounding_box()``.

Net code goes down (~150 lines deleted, ~80 added), reliability goes up
(actionability checks are back), and the author syntax is unchanged — every
existing spec records the same.
