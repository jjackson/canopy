record_video.py — Silent video recording for canopy:walkthrough specs.

Reads the spec YAML and replays each scene's URL + actions through a Playwright
Chromium context with ``record_video`` enabled, then converts the resulting
webm to mp4 via ffmpeg. Produces one silent mp4 alongside the HTML deck.

The recording loop lives in :class:`walkthrough._lib.orchestrator.Recorder` —
this script is a thin CLI over it. To customise behaviour (skip nav when the
URL hasn't changed, alternate viewport, custom hooks), subclass ``Recorder``
in a one-off script and call ``.run(page, scenes)``; no need to fork this CLI.

Usage:
    python3 record_video.py \\
        --spec docs/walkthroughs/<name>.yaml \\
        --output screenshots/walkthroughs/<name>.mp4 \\
        [--cookies /tmp/walkthrough-cookies.json | --storage-state /tmp/state.json] \\
        [--input /tmp/walkthrough-run-data.json] \\
        [--scene 2,4 | --scene 2-4 | --scene name-match] \\
        [--skip-same-url] \\
        [--report run-report.json] \\
        [--snapshots screenshots/walkthroughs/<name>/] \\
        [--snapshot-empty-scenes] \\
        [--prewarm | --no-prewarm] \\
        [--skip-setup]

``--spec`` is the source of truth for scenes. ``--input`` is accepted for
backward compatibility: a walkthrough-run-data.json from canopy:walkthrough
narrows the spec's scenes to the ones that were actually captured (so a
``--scene 3`` partial run records exactly that scene). When ``--input`` is
absent the full spec is recorded.

Specs with a ``setup:`` block (the data-setup contract) get their synthetic
generator command run BEFORE recording — honoring ``rerun: per_render | once``
— and the ``${var}`` placeholders in scene URLs / action targets resolved from
the command's outputs JSON. ``--skip-setup`` skips the command (but still
loads the outputs) for fast re-renders when the data is known-fresh; demos
that mutate state during recording must not use it.

Specs with ``prewarm: true`` (or CLI ``--prewarm``; ``--no-prewarm`` wins the
other way) get a pre-warm pass after setup + auth and BEFORE the recorded
context exists: a separate non-recorded context visits each unique resolved
scene URL once, so cold caches are paid off camera instead of as frozen
frames. Best-effort — see :func:`run_prewarm`.
