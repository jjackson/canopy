"""DDD schema module — re-export shim over the neutral narrative substrate.

The generic narrative / evidence-gap / eval / review-package models now live in
``scripts.narrative.models`` so non-DDD consumers (an ACE AI-video pipeline,
ace-web) can reuse them without importing the ``ddd`` namespace. This module
re-exports all of them and keeps the DDD-only ``RunState`` (the converge
lifecycle) defined here, so every ``from scripts.ddd.schemas.models import X``
importer and ``python -m scripts.ddd.*`` entry point keeps working unchanged.
