"""DDD narrative-coherence check.

Catches the failure modes the actionability eval doesn't:
  1. OUTCOME LEAKAGE — a scene asserts specific values that a LATER step
     (or the action this scene itself describes) is supposed to GENERATE.
     The persona can't know those values in advance of running the action.
  2. (Temporal order — reserved for future LLM augmentation.)
  3. (Persona-can't-do-that — reserved for future LLM augmentation.)

For v1 this implements rule (1) only, using a small, high-precision pattern
catalog targeted at the failure modes seen in real specs. Verbs come from a
small "outcome verbs" set; numeric patterns come from a short catalog tuned
for false-positive avoidance (input configs like "100 buildings per work area"
or "opportunity 123" are NOT flagged).

The rule is intentionally narrow: per-scene `show` + `concept_claim` fields
are the disciplined area (each beat = one moment). The narrative paragraph
is a higher-level overview and is allowed to mention outcomes in passing.

CLI:
    python -m scripts.ddd.narrative_coherence <spec_path>
    exits 0 on pass, 1 on fail, 2 on usage error.
