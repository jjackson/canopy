"""Emit first-class *narrative snippets* from a converged DDD run.

A DDD narrative already carries, per scene/beat, the two things a video snippet
fundamentally needs:

  * **exact in/out timestamps** — from the recorder's per-scene timing
    (``run-report-iter<N>.json`` → ``scenes[].start_seconds`` / ``duration_seconds``);
  * **one clean sentence** — the scene's ``concept_claim`` (a single falsifiable
    beat), which doubles as the caption / lower-third text AND the voiceover script.

So a snippet here is a *logical* range into the run's master walkthrough clip plus
its sentence — NOT a physically re-cut file. The same manifest drives two
downstream consumers in ACE: (a) the first-class snippet *library* (each snippet
stored with its in/out + narration, far richer than a whole-clip + slug), and
(b) the semi-gloss *explainer* render (sequence the ranges, each with per-beat
ElevenLabs VO + a lower-third from the sentence).

This is the canopy/source half of the planned canopy↔ACE narrative substrate,
scoped to the snippet/explainer use case: canopy owns the narrative + timing + the
master clip; ACE owns the library, voice synthesis, and render.

    The recorder's per-scene clip length is wall-clock — it bakes in slow-load
    ``wait_for`` time, the end-of-scene hold, and the snapshot dwell. Those show
    as static dead air, and they can sit anywhere: trailing (page loaded then
    sat), mid-clip (a slow async load between two actions), or leading.

    We find on-screen motion (ffmpeg scene-change) across the whole range and
    keep the moving spans, collapsing any gap with no motion for longer than
    ``gap_max`` down to ``dwell`` seconds (a brief beat of the settled state),
    and trimming the trailing static to ``last_motion + tail``. The kept spans
    are returned as ordered sub-ranges; the renderer plays them back-to-back, so
    each collapsed gap becomes a clean jump-cut. Generalizes a trailing-only
    trim to leading / mid / trailing dead air.

    **Pace contract:** ``keep_dwell=True`` (set by the caller for ``pace: teach``
    scenes) returns the scene's FULL range untouched — teach scenes are NOT
    de-dwelled, because their holds are deliberate: a teach beat sits on a
    highlighted table/column for 8-15s while the voiceover explains it, and that
    held footage carries the narration. Collapsing it to ``dwell`` would leave
    the VO running over a frozen frame. ``flow`` and default/None scenes pass
    ``keep_dwell=False`` (the default) and de-dwell as before.
