"""DDD UnifiedSpec structural QA (SP2.2).

Pure-python, no LLM.  Delegates structural + semantic rules to validate.py;
adds QA-specific falsifiability checks on Scene.concept_claim.

Exposes:
    spec_qa(spec_obj_or_path) -> Verdict

Rules checked:
    (via validate.py → _semantic_unified_spec)
    (b) Scene.provenance must match a SpineItem.id in the linked why_brief
    (e) Scene.persona must be defined in the personas dict
    (f) why_brief declared but not resolvable → problem
    Plus Pydantic-required fields (name, narrative, base_url, personas, scenes)

    (QA-specific, not in validate.py)
    (g) every Scene.concept_claim must be non-empty / non-whitespace
    (h) every Scene.concept_claim must be falsifiable — fails if it matches
        a banned list of pure-marketing phrases, OR is too short to be specific.
    (i) ${...} placeholders in scene URLs / action targets ⇒ the spec must
        declare a `setup:` block with `outputs:` (the synthetic generator that
        mints those variables). Declared-but-unused outputs are fine.
    (j) "show, don't tell" — a scene that DECLARES actions but scripts ONLY
        non-effecting ones (hover/scroll_to/wait_for) while its narration /
        concept_claim promises an effecting verb (create/fill/submit/award/
        select/publish/enter/type) is a hover-only "claimed, not shown" demo.
        Scoped to the actions list (NOT a prose-only verb check — a scene with
        no actions is exempt). Distinct from the removed falsifiability
        verb-check, which scanned prose alone and false-positived.

Returns the ``Verdict`` model from scripts/ddd/schemas/models.py.
``verdict="pass"`` when all rules pass; ``verdict="fail"`` with a
``blocking_reason`` listing every violation when any rule fires.

On missing path, malformed input, or None, returns a ``fail`` Verdict
instead of raising — consistent with the ``-> Verdict`` contract.

CLI:
    python -m scripts.ddd.spec_qa <spec_path>
    exits 0 on pass, 1 on fail, 2 on usage error

# Status-tag parentheticals that don't belong in a story-beat scene title.
# A scene title is a moment in the demo the viewer watches ("Maya picks the

# in the why_brief spine + feature provenance, not the title.

# "Show, don't tell" gate (action-fidelity).
#
# A scene that NARRATES an effecting act — "create / fill out / submit / award /
# select / publish / enter / type" — but scripts only NON-effecting actions
# (hover / scroll_to / wait_for) is the "claimed, not shown" demo: the
# walkthrough asserts an action it never performs. The judge can only see one
# still frame per scene, so a hover-only "create the solicitation" scene scores
# the same as one that genuinely fills + submits. Catch it structurally, before
# any render or judge, at the spec gate.
#
# SCOPE — deliberately narrow, to stay clear of the removed falsifiability
# verb-check (which scanned the claim for verbs and caused FALSE POSITIVES):
#   * This rule is about the ACTIONS LIST, not the prose. It fires ONLY when the
#     scene DECLARES actions (a non-empty `actions:` block) that are ALL
#     non-effecting. A scene with NO actions at all is the legacy scroll-pan
#     narrative beat — exempt (the narration is the whole point; there is no
#     "action it should have performed").
#   * The effecting verbs below are matched as whole words in the scene's
#     narrative / concept_claim only to decide whether the narration PROMISES an
#     action. The decision to BLOCK is gated on the actions list, never on the
#     prose alone — so a nominalized claim with no scripted actions never trips.
