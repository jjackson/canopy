"""Unified verdict loader — one schema over six judge artifacts (canopy#265 item 1).

DDD's judges historically emitted three structural schemas:

  * concept / user_artifact / actionability / why — the canonical weighted-
    dimension ``Verdict`` YAML (``scripts.narrative.models.Verdict``)
  * ``verdict-timing.json`` — render_locally.py's deterministic shape
    (``{verdict, overallScore, coverage, findings[]}``, camelCase, no dimensions)
  * ``verdict-video.json`` — the video judge's per-scene shape
    (``{scenes: [{beat, scores{}, overall, verdict, findings[]}]}``)

``load_verdict(path)`` normalizes any of them into the one ``Verdict`` model and
stamps ``kind`` / ``gate`` / ``live_state_verified`` defaults per verdict family
(from ``KIND_DEFAULTS``) when the emitter didn't set them. Downstream code
(``run_pipeline.compute_convergence_all``, reporting) is generic over the result —
adding a judge means adding a KIND_DEFAULTS row, not editing the assembler.

Returns ``None`` when the artifact carries nothing to aggregate (timing eval
n/a on a no-form walkthrough; video verdict with zero scenes).
