/**
 * DDD timing eval — deterministic VO↔UI sync verdict for a narrated walkthrough.
 *
 * The DDD concept/visual judge scores per-scene SCREENSHOTS for concept soundness
 * and never looks at the produced video, so the rendered video's audio-visual
 * timing (does the cursor reach a field when the VO names it; does footage run out
 * under a long narration) is unjudged. This module fills that gap with a PURE,
 * LLM-free verdict computed from the same data render.ts already has: each scene's
 * `action_marks` + its ElevenLabs VO alignment (via the actionsync anchors) + the
 * footage/VO durations.
 *
 * It scores ONE axis — the warp's actual job, which nothing else measures:
 * FIELD SYNC — of the form fields the narration actually NAMES, how many land on
 * their spoken word (became warp anchors) vs drift (dropped as inversions: the
 * narration enumerates fields in a different ORDER than the form lays them out).
 * It deliberately does NOT score held-frame overrun (VO playing over a held
 * frame): a teach hold under the voice is intentional, and the render already
 * prints a footage-vs-VO overrun line — folding it in here just double-counts and
 * punishes legitimate teach holds. The denominator is fields the narration NAMES,
 * so a scene that never names a field (a pure dashboard read) is "n/a", not a fail.
 *
 * Output mirrors the other ddd verdicts (overall_score 0–5 + pass|warn|fail +
 * per-scene rows + findings) so it can sit alongside verdict-concept.yaml.
 * Thresholds are PROVISIONAL (like the concept rubric) — calibrate on real runs.
