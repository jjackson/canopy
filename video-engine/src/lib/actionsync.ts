/**
 * Action↔word voiceover sync — piecewise footage time-warp (pure).
 *
 * A walkthrough beat plays one footage range under one VO clip, anchored only at
 * the beat's start frame. A scene that narrates a form speaks its field names in
 * a compact sentence while the footage demonstrates each field one-by-one, so the
 * spoken field name races ahead of the cursor ("the VO is moving faster than the
 * UI"). See ``docs/action-word-sync.md``.
 *
 * The recorder stamps each field action with its footage timestamp; snippets map
 * those into ON-SCREEN seconds and tag each with candidate narration words
 * (`action_marks`). Here we resolve each mark's word to its VO time and build a
 * warp plan: between two word-anchors the footage plays at the constant rate that
 * lands the next field exactly when the VO speaks it.
 *
 * Two stages:
 *   1. {@link buildActionWarp} — anchors → pieces in the ON-SCREEN footage domain.
 *   2. {@link composeWithSegments} — split pieces at de-dwell segment boundaries
 *      and map on-screen → master-clip seconds, so a constant-rate piece never
 *      straddles a jump-cut. (Teach scenes are single-segment → a pass-through.)
 *
 * Graceful: <1 usable anchor ⇒ `[]` ⇒ the caller keeps today's linear playback.
