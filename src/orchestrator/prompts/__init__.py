"""Prompt template loader.

Prompts live as packaged data files (``orchestrator/prompts/<name>.md``) and are
resolved via ``importlib.resources`` rather than ``Path(__file__).parent`` so the
lookup is install-safe — it finds the ``.md`` even when ``orchestrator`` is
installed as a wheel or relocated/zipped, where a filesystem-relative path may not
point at the data files. Belt-and-suspenders with the ``package-data`` declaration
in ``pyproject.toml`` (#351): the data ships AND is addressed portably.
