"""Per-AGENT bring-up coverage — `canopy agent coverage`.

`canopy agent health` answers "is this agent's workload healthy for its NEXT turn"
(board + inbox, point-in-time). THIS module answers a longitudinal question: "how
much of what we said this agent would be is actually LIVE yet" — which declared
skills have ever fired, which fired and then stopped, and which never fired despite
having the chance.

The fleet is in bring-up, not maintenance: things are built and exercised inside
short bursts (1-2 active days separated by ~6 dark days), then decay when they
can't quite be made to work. So OPPORTUNITY IS COUNTED IN BURSTS SURVIVED, never in
wall-clock days -- a day-based age gate spans whole bursts and suppresses exactly
the most interesting skills. A trough is not a finding: an agent with no bursts
since a skill was written yields no finding at all.

Facts and deterministic buckets only -- WHY a skill never fired (blocked? forgotten?
premature?) is the caller's job (Ada's fleet-persona-coverage skill judges; this
module never does). Read-only by construction: writes to no repo, mailbox, board, or
turn queue.

Same shape as agent_health.py: small probes with injectable dependencies (``call``
for canopy-web, ``now``, ``projects_dir``), composed by ``run_agent_coverage``.
