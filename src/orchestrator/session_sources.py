"""Injectable session-corpus sources — the seam that stops the cross-user blind spot.

WHY this exists: `agent_coverage.coverage_report` reports which of an agent's
declared skills ever FIRED, by scanning that agent's Claude Code transcripts. It
found them via `agent_review.find_turn_transcripts(repo, hours,
projects_dir=CLAUDE_PROJECTS)` where `CLAUDE_PROJECTS = Path.home() / ".claude" /
"projects"` — ONE place: the CURRENT user's home. This machine has TWO macOS
accounts (jjackson + acedimagi) JJ alternates between when he runs out of
tokens. Scanning only one inverts the report's conclusions: `hal/architect` was
reported `never_live` ("13 commits, never fired") when it had actually fired
three times — on the OTHER account, in a worktree checkout invisible to the
single-home scan. Every "never fired" claim was untrustworthy until this fix.

`harvest.py`'s module docstring already states the rule this module encodes:
"Cross-user or the conclusion inverts. JJ alternates macOS accounts (acedimagi +
jjackson)" and "Flag own blindness. `confidence: half-blind` is a first-class
field whenever any user's corpus is unreadable." `harvest.user_session_roots`
already did the local glob + readable check for exactly one caller — this
module pulls that logic out from under its one hardcoded call site into a
typed, N-source SEAM, so the next reader doesn't collapse it back into a single
`/Users/*/.claude/projects` glob duplicated across modules.

The human's requirement: "our skills should have N places they can look,
including cloud runtimes when we add those." So this is a typed list of
sources, one adapter per `kind` — NOT a hardcoded two-account glob. Only the
`local` adapter is implemented today (no speculative cloud code). A configured
source whose `kind` has no registered adapter comes back `readable=False` with
a non-empty `reason` — NEVER silently dropped. That is the forward-compat
property: someone configures a cloud runtime before its adapter exists and the
report degrades LOUD (half-blind) instead of quietly under-reporting.
