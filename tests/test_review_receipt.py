"""Tests for the pre-send review rail (agent-core: review-receipt).

The rail exists because the pre-send review is an invariant that fails under load, and
prose can't hold it: an agent reviews draft v1, revises twice as new findings land, and
sends v3 unreviewed — each revision feeling like "improving reviewed work" rather than a
new draft needing review. (Eva, 2026-07-15: the re-review caught a named shortlist target
missing from the body entirely.) Keying the receipt to the BODY's fingerprint is what
makes that specific failure impossible: revise the body, the fingerprint moves, the stale
receipt no longer matches.
