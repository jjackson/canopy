"""Guard against canopy plugin names colliding with Claude Code built-in slash commands.

Background: When a plugin command/skill/agent shares a name with a built-in
Claude Code slash command (e.g. `/doctor`, `/help`, `/clear`), Claude Code
silently routes the qualified `canopy:<name>` invocation to the built-in
handler — and worse, the entire skill description block can be dropped
from the system prompt at session start. This was discovered the hard way
when `canopy:doctor` collided with the native `/doctor` and 142 skill
descriptions vanished. The skill was renamed to `canopy:canopy-doctor`
in v0.2.79.

The reserved set below is conservative (names confirmed reserved by Claude
Code at the time of writing). When Claude Code adds a new built-in that
collides with an existing canopy plugin, the test fails with the rename
guidance, NOT with a silent prompt-truncation regression in production.

If a future Claude Code release introduces a new built-in slash command,
add it to `RESERVED_BUILTINS` here. If a canopy contributor introduces a
new skill/command/agent that lands on a reserved name, the test fails
with a rename suggestion before the change ships.
