"""Tests for ``Recorder.take_snapshot`` retrying once on WebGL screenshot
timeout.

Background: WebGL / Mapbox / Canvas-heavy pages hang
``Page.captureScreenshot`` in headless Chromium — the recurring SwiftShader-
headless bug
(``reference_browse_webgl_swiftshader``). The DDD agent's manual workaround on
``microplans-10-wards-fullrun-2026-06-02-001`` was to re-capture the failing
scene in a separate ``playwright.sync_api`` session with an explicit 8-10s
sleep before retrying ``page.screenshot()``. This should be a built-in retry
path.

Contract:
  - First screenshot timeout → settle 8s → retry once.
  - Retry succeeds → PNG written, ``snapshots_taken`` updated.
  - Retry also fails → ``take_snapshot`` doesn't raise; text dump still
    written (so visual-judge has at least one input per scene); the failed
    scene is NOT added to ``snapshots_taken``.
