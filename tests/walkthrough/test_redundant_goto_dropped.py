"""Tests for the redundant-first-goto strip in ``build_scenes_from_spec``.

Background: PR #100 added ``Scene.url`` as the declarative entry point — the
orchestrator's ``run_scene`` already does ``page.goto(scene.url)`` before
running the action list. But many existing specs *also* lead with
``{kind: goto, target: <same-url>}`` (the pre-#100 entry pattern), so the
recorder ends up navigating twice — a ~2.5s reload that the viewer sees as
dead-air right after the scene title.

This test pins the strip rule:

  - leading ``goto`` whose absolutized target equals ``scene.url`` → drop it
  - leading ``goto`` whose target is different from ``scene.url`` → keep it
    (intentional reload-then-elsewhere pattern is preserved)
  - leading goto when no explicit ``scene.url`` is set, but the goto's own
    target defines the URL the orchestrator will navigate to → drop it (it
    would otherwise fire twice — the orchestrator's nav + the action list)
  - non-leading goto → never dropped (could be a mid-scene route change)
