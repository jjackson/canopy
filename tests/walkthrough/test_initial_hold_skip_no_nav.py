"""Tests for skipping ``initial_hold_ms`` when no navigation happens.

Background: ``initial_hold_ms`` is a blind post-nav settle — it gives the
freshly-loaded page a moment to paint before the cursor starts moving. PR
#111 added a skip when the first action is ``wait_for`` (the wait_for IS
the settle). This extends the skip: when ``goto_for_scene`` returns
``None`` (stay-on-page scene — typical of the continuation pattern in
``SkipSameUrlRecorder`` and any scene authored without ``url:``), there's
no page-load transition to settle for. The previous scene's
``final_hold_ms`` already provided any transition pause.

These tests pin the new skip path while preserving every existing case
(PR #111 behavior remains bit-identical for url-having scenes).
