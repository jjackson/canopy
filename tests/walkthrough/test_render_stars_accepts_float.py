"""Unit tests for ``_render_stars`` float tolerance (PR #105 gap 3).

The judge schema (``ai_evaluation.score``) is a float — 4.0, 4.5, 5.0.
``_render_stars`` used to be ``"★" * score``, which throws ``TypeError`` on
float multiplication. The DDD agent in the microplans-10-wards run worked
around this with an inline ``int(round(score))`` at the call site; the fix is
to push that round into the renderer so every caller benefits.

These tests pin:
  - ``_render_stars(4.5)`` doesn't raise, renders 4 or 5 stars (rounded)
  - integer scores keep rendering identically (no regression)
  - ``max_score=5.0`` (defensive) is also tolerated
  - the visible numeric tail still shows the underlying float so callers
    can read "4.5/5" in the deck without precision loss
