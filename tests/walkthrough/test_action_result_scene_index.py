"""Unit tests for per-action ``scene_index`` stamping (PR #105 gap 2).

The DDD orchestrator reported every action in ``run-report.json`` came back
with ``scene_index: None``. Looking at the code: the orchestrator's
``run_scene`` knew which scene each action belonged to, but ``execute_action``
was called scene-agnostically and the result was never tagged.

The fix is in ``Recorder.run_scene``: stamp the scene index onto each
``ActionResult`` via ``dataclasses.replace`` (the dataclass is frozen, so we
can't mutate in place). This keeps ``execute_action`` scene-agnostic — the
dispatcher doesn't need to know which scene it's serving — and lets downstream
graders group results by scene without re-parsing the spec.

Tests here pin:
  - every result in ``RunReport`` has ``scene_index`` matching its source scene
  - the index is the 1-based ORIGINAL spec index (not the loop's position
    after ``--scene`` filtering)
  - an explicit ``scene_index`` kwarg on ``run_scene`` overrides the dict field
  - the field is preserved through ``RunReport.to_json``
