"""Regression tests for #scene-N deep-links in the generated slideshow deck.

The deck is a one-slide-at-a-time JS deck: it tracks a ``currentSlide`` index
and shows one ``.slide`` at a time (inactive slides are ``display:none``). It
emits stable ``id="scene-N"`` anchors on scene slides, and the DDD pipeline
documents + surfaces ``<DECK_URL>#scene-N`` deep-links (findings, reviews) so a
reviewer lands on the exact judged scene.

The bug (issue #103): the deck had no ``location.hash``/``hashchange`` handling,
so every deep-link opened on scene 1. These tests pin the contract:

  1. scene anchors are emitted using the ORIGINAL spec index (``scene_index``),
     so a partial run that renders spec scene 2 anchors at ``#scene-2``;
  2. the navigation JS reads the hash on load, listens for ``hashchange``, and
     resolves a scene id to a slide index by element identity (NOT arithmetic),
     so a non-contiguous set of scenes still maps correctly.

The hash→index resolution is JS, so we re-implement the same regex + identity
lookup the deck ships and assert it on the real anchor set the generator
produced. If the generator's anchor scheme drifts from what the JS expects,
this test catches it.
