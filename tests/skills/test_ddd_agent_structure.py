"""Structural invariants for the ddd orchestrator agent (SP5).

Pins the load-bearing strings in the agent file and command file.
Does NOT exercise runtime behavior — drift here is a bug.

Checked invariants:
  1.  Agent file exists at plugins/canopy/agents/ddd.md.
  2.  Command file exists at plugins/canopy/commands/ddd.md.
  3.  Frontmatter: name=ddd, model=inherit, memory=user.
  4.  All 8 DDD skills named in chain order.
  5.  TWO-gate pause policy stated: concept_change + external_release.
  6.  Nothing-else-blocks rule stated explicitly.
  7.  Routing section distinguishes two finding sources:
      A. Design-findings routes (from ddd-concept-eval's design_findings.json):
         PRODUCT → /design-review, /review, or /qa
         CONCEPT → re-run ddd-spec (edit narration/design_intent)
         RESEARCH → autonomous investigation + re-run Phase 0
         DEFER → log only (non-blocking)
      B. Why-brief gap types (from Phase 0 ddd-why-brief):
         RESEARCH → autonomous investigation
         CAPABILITY → product-build task  ← originates HERE, not in design_findings
         DECISION → concept_change pause
  8.  compute_convergence referenced.
  9.  MAX_ITERATIONS referenced.
 10.  Reads .canopy/ddd/context and .canopy/ddd/learnings.
 11.  Suggest-then-confirm self-tuning mentioned (never auto-apply).
 12.  Digest email referenced (PM-loop autonomous digest style).
 13.  Command file has description + allowed-tools including Skill or Agent.
