"""Structural invariants for the ddd-run skill (SP4.3).

Pins the load-bearing strings and shape of SKILL.md and the command file.
Does NOT exercise behavior — drift here is a bug.

Checked invariants:
    1. SKILL.md exists with correct name in frontmatter.
    2. Preamble (update check) present.
    3. ## Inputs section names run_id, unified_spec, and why_brief.
    4. ## Procedure section present.
    5. QA-gate step: references python -m scripts.ddd.spec_qa.
    6. Render step: references the canopy walkthrough engine
       (canopy:walkthrough or walkthrough skill).
    7. Concept judge step: references ddd-concept-eval.
    8. User-artifact judge step: references visual-judge (canopy:visual-judge
       or visual-judge) with audience="feature user" signal.
    9. Both judges are dispatched ("parallel" or "both" or two separate calls).
   10. Assemble+convergence step: references assemble_run_state and
       compute_convergence.
   11. Command file exists with description, allowed-tools (incl. Skill or Agent).
