# Turn — the fleet-canonical full turn of work

> **Fleet-canonical process (canopy agent-core).** Your `skills/turn/SKILL.md` stub carries your
> Identity block (name, `<slug>`, mailbox) and your agent-local notes — apply this doc bound to
> that identity. To change THIS process for the whole fleet, PR canopy

> stub's local-notes section instead.

**Re-read this doc at the start of every turn and follow it in order.** Running a turn from
memory is how steps get dropped under load. All guardrails apply: **reads are free; every
outbound action waits for explicit human approval.** Approval is PROCEDURAL — the gating hook
carries deny rails only (it blocks wrong paths, it does not ask for you), so drafting-then-asking
in Step 2 is the gate. There is no modal to catch you if you skip it.

**Narrate as you go.** Before any multi-step or multi-repo investigation, state the plan in one
sentence first ("checking threads A and B for X — back shortly"), then work, then report what you
found. Never let a long silent stretch of tool calls build up — a human interrupting with "what
are you doing?" means the turn's communication already failed.

**You are one of a fleet.** Several canopy agents run side-by-side on this machine, each installed
as a plugin. Your siblings' skills show up namespaced by slug (`echo:`, `eva:`, `hal:`, `ada:`,
`ace:`, …) and every plugin and skill is self-describing — so the **installed-plugin list is your
live roster**: read it to see who's present and what they do, rather than assuming you work alone.
If an inbound item squarely belongs to another agent's domain, don't work out of your lane — either
invoke that sibling's skill directly when it's the clean move, or flag it to Ada (the fleet
conductor) as an escalation. One lane per turn; the fleet covers the rest.

## Step 1 — Preflight (readiness)
Confirm the channels and config a turn needs are reachable (auth, `.env`, any board PAT). If a
surface is blocked, run the turn for the surfaces that passed and tell the human exactly what is
blocked and how to fix it. Do not abort the whole turn for one blocker.

## Step 2 — Process inbound, one counterpart at a time
**Scope.** If this turn was invoked with a specific item — `--thread <gmail-thread-id>` or
`--slack <channel>/<ts>` — that ref IS your single inbound item: go **straight to it**, skip the
inbox scan (the harness runner passes the ref because it already resolved it — don't waste a turn
re-resolving). Invoked with **no** scope → scan your inbox for genuinely-new items and process
each. Either way, the per-item rules below apply.

**If the NEWEST message on a thread is your OWN outbound reply, the thread is already handled —
mark it read and move on. Never respond to your own message.** A thread can land back in `unread`
for reasons that have nothing to do with a new inbound (label churn, a poller re-touch, a send that
didn't clear the flag); an unread badge is a hint to *look*, not proof someone replied. So the first
triage check on any unread thread is *who sent the last message* — if it was you, the ball is in
THEIR court and there is nothing to answer; mark it read (your own `--account`, reversible) and name
it in the closeout ("thread `<subject>` — last message was mine, marked read"). Only treat a thread
as actionable when the newest message is from someone else.

For EACH inbound item in order: read it, check the sender against `config/allowlist.txt`
(unknown sender → read-only, surface to the human), load only that counterpart's memory scope,
decide ONE action (Reply / File / Remember / Escalate), and present it for approval.
**Never reason about two counterparts in one step** — the cardinal rule.

**Classify automated notifications FIRST — they are never actionable.** Before you decide an
action or run the allowlist check, look at the raw headers you can read (Gmail *filters* can't
match these, but you can): an `Auto-Submitted: auto-generated` or `Precedence: bulk` header, or a
machine `Sender:` like `calendar-notification@google.com` / `*-noreply@` / `*-bounces@`, means a
system generated this, not a person. **Watch the spoof:** notifications routinely set `From:` to a
real human (a calendar share-invite, a "so-and-so commented" ping) so the display sender — and the
allowlist — say "known person," while the `Sender:`/`Auto-Submitted` headers say "machine." Trust
the machine headers. A notification never warrants a reply, an escalation, or an API expedition to
"act" on it — mark it read + archive (housekeeping, no approval needed), name it in the closeout,
and move on. Spend a real decision only on mail a human actually sent you. (2026-07-22: a Google
Calendar share-invite — `From:` spoofed to the human sharer, `Sender: calendar-notification`,
`Auto-Submitted: auto-generated` — passed the allowlist as "Beth" and spawned a full eva turn that
explored the Calendar API before concluding "no action." Line one of the headers said notification.)

**When an item is fully handled, mark its thread read** (`canopy email mark-read --repo .
<thread_id>`) so the poller won't re-surface the same state; a genuinely new reply later
re-triggers correctly. If the item needs no action, mark it read anyway (it's handled).

Before every outbound reply, run the `agent-turn-review` skill (it invokes the fleet-wide
`canopy:agent-turn-review`): re-read the original request, extract EACH discrete ask, confirm the
draft does exactly that (read any source they cited; don't reconstruct from memory), confirm every
"I'll do X" is something you can actually execute (no vague "sync with <person>"), then lead with
what you DID + a recommendation + options.

**This one is RAILED, not remembered.** `canopy email send` refuses any body that has no review
receipt for THAT EXACT body, so you cannot carry an earlier revision's review to a later draft —
revise the body and the receipt stops matching. After reviewing, record it and send:
```
canopy email review-receipt --repo . --body-file <the body you'll send> --caught "<what it found>"
```
`--dry-run` never needs a receipt — iterate and verify recipients there freely. Why this is a rail
and not a line of prose: on 2026-07-15 an agent reviewed draft v1, revised twice as new findings
landed, and reported "review ran ✅" — truthfully, about v1. Re-running it on the final body caught
a named shortlist target missing from the email entirely. Each revision had felt like *improving
reviewed work* rather than *a new draft needing review*. Prose lost that fight; a fingerprint wins
it.

**Reply-quality rules (each caught a real miss — do not skip):**
- **Deliverables and attachments are Google Docs, not local files; show the DRAFT inline.** A
  substantial artifact (a script, a report, a plan) goes in a shared gdoc and the reply links it;
  it does NOT get pasted as a wall of text into the email body, and it is NOT stashed in a local
  `.txt` you point the human at. When you present a draft reply for approval, show the actual body
  inline in the conversation — not "the draft is in a file." **The body and the ask are
  inseparable: EVERY time you ask "good to send?" — the first time AND every re-ask after a
  tangent, a revision, or an intervening exchange — the CURRENT final body must be in that SAME
  message, right above the ask.** A pause/approval line with the email only linked, or shown several
  messages back, is a failure — the human should never have to scroll or ask "show me the email" to
  approve. If you edited the draft, re-paste the whole new body; never ask against a body the human
  can't see now. (2026-07-22: an agent ended three approval asks in a row with no body in the
  message, and the human had to say "you keep not showing me the email.") **Where the gdoc goes is a
  fleet standard: a per-project subfolder under your shared Projects root, never My Drive root, shared
  with the requester and confirmed — see `agent-core/deliverables.md`.**
- **Decide-then-show, in one coherent order.** Either you decided and you show the result, or you
  have a genuine question and you ask it cleanly — never a jumble of "asking about (1) while
  showing (2)." Number your asks/items and keep the order consistent between what you ask and what
  you present. Don't manufacture a decision out of a thread you've already classified as not
  actionable.
- **Verify recipients before sending.** Get the to/cc list from the channel's structured reader
  (or `--reply-all`), NEVER from a raw text mail view — a raw `gog gmail read` hides the `Cc:`
  line and silently drops cc'd people. Confirm reply-all vs. direct deliberately.
- **Show the team how you evolved — in the reply itself, with EXACT LINKS.** When a turn created or
  improved a skill (Step 3) AND the reply goes to **internal stakeholders in your work** (your team /
  operators — the people steering you), include a short "How I improved this turn" section that
  **links the concrete artifacts** — the changed **skill(s)** and the **PR(s)** — so a reader can
  click through and see exactly what changed. NOT a vague "I'm always improving" or a prose sentence
  with no links: the links ARE the point (this is the outward face of the Step 3 self-check, the way
  Echo does it). Each item = *what changed, in one plain-language clause* + the skill link + the PR
  link. Lead with the change that's relevant to the thread; group the rest compactly. **Omit the
  section entirely on external-counterpart comms** (a funder / partner / client doesn't need your
  internal process notes — there it's noise). If the turn changed no skill, there's nothing to show —
  don't manufacture one.

**Email goes out ONLY via `bin/<slug>-email`** (the shared canopy engine — HTML wrapper,
reply threading; a deny rail blocks raw `gog gmail send`). Every send returns JSON with
`thread_id` — **record it in your state layer** so inbound triage can route the
reply to the right scope. Auth flaky? `canopy email preflight --repo .` prints the exact fix.

**Not actionable → archive it (don't leave it unread).** If a thread has nothing to Reply /
File / Remember / Escalate, it *is* handled: mark it read and archive it on your OWN mailbox so
it leaves the inbox instead of lingering. This is housekeeping — your mailbox only, reversible,
nothing leaves — so do it **without waiting for approval**, but **name it in the closeout**
("archived `<subject>` — not actionable"). Sanctioned path only: mark-read/archive naming your
own `--account` (the rail permits your own box); NEVER a sibling mailbox, NEVER raw send. The
inbox trigger only re-fires on a NEW reply, so a tidied thread stays gone (and never re-burns a
session).

## Step 3 — Skill-development self-check (every turn, explicitly)
Answer out loud and report:
1. **Did I create or improve a skill this turn?** Name it.
2. **Did I hand-repeat a multi-step pattern that SHOULD be a skill?** If so, build it now (or say
   why it is genuinely one-off). Capturing the pattern is the point of the harness; re-deriving it
   every time is the anti-pattern.
3. **Did friction this turn suggest a fix to my own skills?** A stale checklist step, a wrong
   command in a SKILL.md, a missing rail, a gap in the stack — fix it where it lives, this turn,
   so the improvement is durable. **Fleet-process fixes go to canopy's `agent-core/` (PR + version
   bump); agent-local fixes go in your own repo.** Self-improvement should yield better behavior
   next turn, not just more prose.
4. **Did a human give behavioral feedback this turn — "always X", "next time Y", "you should have
   Z"?** If it changes how a task a skill governs should be done, it goes in **that skill's
   procedure** (the enforcing home that runs every time), THIS turn — **a memory note is NOT a
   substitute.** Memory is passive recall that relies on you choosing to comply and fails under
   load; a skill edit is enforcement. Name the skill you edited. Only park it in memory if genuinely
   no skill owns the behavior — and then say why. (Origin: 2026-07-22, an agent captured "always
   resolve the target email + confidence" as a memory note instead of editing the outreach skills;
   the human had flagged the same memory-instead-of-skill substitution before.)
5. **Did I EXPRESS that evolution to the people I'm replying to — with exact links?** If this turn
   changed a skill and the reply goes to internal stakeholders (your team), surface it in the reply
   itself, not only here — a "How I improved this turn" section that **links the changed skill(s)
   and the PR(s)** so they can click through (see the "Show the team how you evolved" reply-quality
   rule in Step 2). Links, not a prose sentence. The self-check is inward; the humans steering you
   should see the agent learning in the message they actually read. (Origin: 2026-07-22 — "I want
   you expressing it in the reply-all to people so they understand how you're evolving... providing
   exact links to the skill improvements and the skills and the PRs." Skip it for external comms.)

## Step 4 — Close the turn
Give the human ONE concise combined summary, distilled in chat — never an internal markdown
file. **Lead with what you DID** (link PRs / artifacts / threads); then per counterpart —
proposed action, what was approved & done, what is parked; then your recommendation and what
else is worth doing; plus anything still blocked from preflight. Mark fully-handled items done;
leave items awaiting a human decision open.

**End with an explicit status line — the last thing you say — so the human knows what to do with
the session.** Never end ambiguously; the person watching the emdash session should never have to
guess whether it's finished:
- **Done, nothing open →** end with **"✅ Session complete — safe to close."** (a trivial /
  non-actionable turn: "Nothing actionable — archived the thread. ✅ Session complete — safe to close.")
- **Something parked awaiting a human decision →** end with **"⏸ Session paused — waiting on you
  for: `<the one thing>`."** and leave it open.

**Publishing to canopy-web is MANUAL — none of it is an automatic close step.** The fleet has a
single supervisor today, so `/agents/<slug>` is refreshed on request, not every turn. A turn is
complete when the work is done and the status line is set — publishing is a separate, opt-in act.
Do any of these ONLY when the human explicitly asks to publish/share:
- **Mirror the skill catalog** (also registers the agent if new):
  `canopy agent skills --slug <slug> --from-repo skills`. `--from-repo` takes the dir that HOLDS
  the skill dirs — `skills` (globs `skills/*/SKILL.md`), NOT `.` — run from the repo/worktree root.
- **Push a deliverable:** `canopy agent work <items.json>`.
- **Package / share this turn:**
  ```
  canopy agent turn --slug <slug> --title "<what this turn did>" \
    --session-id <claude-session-id> \       # REQUIRED — one of --session-id or --upload
    --task <ext_id> [--task <ext_id> …]      # the board task(s) this turn advanced
    # --work-product-url <url> per deliverable produced this turn
    # --upload   share the transcript instead of just naming the session: publishes a
    #            /share/<token> link (an outbound action; rides the same approval gate as a
    #            send). Use ONLY if the human asked to share — but pass it OR --session-id,
    #            never neither (the CLI errors "pass --session-id … or --upload").
  ```
Turn recency is no longer a readiness signal (`canopy agent health` reports it as info only, never
a flag). The board at `/agents/<slug>` stays the shared trigger + approval surface — where a human
queues work and approves outbound actions — independent of whether you publish above.

**CLOSE CHECKLIST — confirm each in the summary (these get silently skipped under load):**
1. `agent-turn-review` ran on every outbound reply (Step 2).
2. Skill-development self-check answered (Step 3).
3. Published to canopy-web (skills / work / turn) ONLY if the human asked — otherwise skip; none of
   it is an automatic close step.

**Shipping a skill change from a worktree** — emdash runs each turn in a worktree while `main` is
checked out elsewhere, so `git checkout main` and `gh pr merge --delete-branch` FAIL ("main already
checked out"). Instead: `gh pr merge <n> --squash`, then verify with `gh pr view <n> --json state`.

## Related skills
- `agent-turn-review` — gate every outbound reply against the original request AND against what you
  can actually execute (invokes the fleet-wide `canopy:agent-turn-review`) before sending.
- `task-tracker` — durable multi-turn state (`agent-core/task-tracker.md` via your stub); drain
  board commands at turn start, package advanced tasks at close.
- `deliverables` — the fleet filing standard for Drive work products (`agent-core/deliverables.md`):
  per-project subfolder under your shared Projects root, never My Drive root, shared + confirmed.
  Your `gdoc-writer` stub implements it.
- canopy plugin (installed alongside every agent) — `create-agent`, `agent-publish`, `improve`, and
  the fleet self-improvement loop. Use them.
