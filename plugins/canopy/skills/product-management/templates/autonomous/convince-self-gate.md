# Convince-self-it's-clean gate

Runs before each PR opens during a `/canopy:pm-autonomous` sprint. Goal: not just "tests pass" but "I'd defend this in a code review." Layered, in order. Any layer failing means the proposal is dropped (logged in the cycle log under `self-review-blocked`) and the loop moves on to re-derive the corresponding email highlight.

Don't skip layers. Don't merge them. The point of the gate is to make a different kind of mistake visible at each stage.

## 3a. Mechanical checks

Run all of these against the staged change. They are CHEAP — run them in parallel where possible.

1. `testing.unit` — must exit 0
2. `testing.lint` — must exit 0
3. `testing.types` — must exit 0
4. **Secret-leak scan (hardcoded patterns; not configurable):**

   ```bash
   git diff --staged | python3 "$PLUGIN_PATH/skills/product-management/scripts/secret_scan.py" --env-file .env
   ```

   Where `$PLUGIN_PATH` is resolved via `installed_plugins.json` as in `config-schema.md`. The `--env-file` flag is omitted if `.env` does not exist.

5. **Diff-size cap:**

   ```bash
   git diff --staged --stat | python3 "$PLUGIN_PATH/skills/product-management/scripts/diff_size_check.py" --limit "$DIFF_LIMIT"
   ```

   Where `$DIFF_LIMIT` is `guardrails.diff_size_limit_lines` from `autonomous.yaml`.

If any mechanical check fails, abandon this proposal — log it in the run log, do NOT try to "fix" by reducing scope. The cycle simply re-derives the email highlight.

## 3b. Self-review pass — five questions, written to the cycle log

Re-read the diff. Answer each question IN WRITING in the cycle log. The act of writing the answer is the gate — vague or evasive answers fail.

1. **What invariant did I just change?** Name a specific contract — input format, return semantics, side-effect ordering, persisted-state shape. Answer "none" or "I don't know" → FAIL.
2. **What's the riskiest line in this diff?** Quote a specific line. "Nothing is risky" on any non-trivial change → FAIL.
3. **What would a senior eng object to in code review?** Name a concrete objection, even if you disagree with it. "Nothing comes to mind" on a non-trivial change → FAIL (probable blind spot).
4. **Did I touch a test that codifies a behavior I'm changing?** If yes, did I update the test's *intent* or merely patch its assertions to match? "Patched the assertions" → FAIL.
5. **Would I be comfortable if this shipped while I was on vacation?** Hesitation → FAIL.

A failure on any question DROPS the proposal — write the question number and a one-sentence reason in the run log under `self-review-blocked`, then re-derive the corresponding email highlight (see Phase C in `cycle.md`).

## 3c. Dogfood pass — prod, not localhost

For any change that's named in a `Try it:` line of the target email, the dogfood is on **deployed prod**, not on a local stack. Localhost dogfood does not count and is not an acceptable substitute.

This is a hard rule. Surfaced across three confirming sprints on ace-web (2026-05-01 cycles 1–3): in every case the local stack was unreachable on the dev's machine (docker socket permissions, port 8000 owned by another tenant, no local Postgres binary, etc.) and the cycle defaulted to "skip dogfood, hope the post-deploy screenshot capture works." That worked — but only because the *real* dogfood was the post-deploy capture all along. The localhost step was ceremony in front of the actual proof.

### Why prod, not localhost

- **Localhost runs different code.** `DEBUG=True`, dev fixtures, in-memory backends, missing prod env vars, dev-only feature flags. A green localhost dogfood does not certify what users see.
- **Localhost screenshots cannot be used for the email** (per `email-format.md` Hard rule #3 — they leak port numbers and seeded fake data). So even when localhost dogfood succeeds, you have to repeat the click-through against prod to gather hero shots — the localhost work is wasted.
- **Localhost is not always reachable.** Worktree-first workflows, shared dev hosts, rotating credentials all break localhost reproducibly. Treating localhost as required forces the cycle into a "skip the gate" branch, which is worse than codifying the prod-only rule.
- **Post-deploy is where the cycle must verify anyway** (Section 3d health check + Phase E.1 prod screenshot capture). Folding dogfood into the same prod-driving harness eliminates a duplicate code path and removes the localhost-dogfood / prod-screenshot drift class of bugs.

### The procedure

The dogfood pass moves AFTER deploy, between 3d (health check) and Phase E (send). The sequence inside Phase C becomes:

1. 3a / 3b → open PR → CI green → merge
2. `shipping.deploy_command` → poll `shipping.deploy_workflow` to completion
3. **3d post-deploy health check** (Section 3d below)
4. **3c dogfood + prod screenshots** (this section, against the deployed change)
5. Phase E.4 render check + Phase E.5 send

Concretely, for each `Try it:` line in the target email:

1. Drive the configured `testing.dogfood.headless_browser_skill` against `<deployed-base-url>` (NOT `testing.dogfood.base_url` — that field's localhost URL is now unused; see deprecation note below).
2. Authenticate via the project's automation login (e.g. `/auth/e2e-login/` for ace-web, project-specific for others; the `headless_browser_skill` should know its own auth path or accept a token via env).
3. Click through the actual user path. Verify the expected behavior visibly happens.
4. Capture the hero screenshot for the highlight at the same time — the `Try it:` dogfood and the `email-format.md` Hard-rule-3 prod screenshot are the **same artifact**. Save into `$EMAIL_WORKDIR/screenshots/` (the Phase E temp working dir) so Phase E.2 can push them straight to the asset branch.
5. Record the gate verdict in the run log. If the click-through fails, this is a fix-forward (counts against `guardrails.max_fix_forward_attempts`), not a "skip dogfood".

### What the cycle is allowed to substitute

If the change is purely backend (no user-visible surface), it CAN skip 3c entirely — but then it CANNOT appear as a `Try it:` highlight; it lives only in the email's footer / internal `*` section. This is the same rule as before, unchanged.

There is **no** escape hatch for "prod is hard to reach today." Prod must be reachable for the deploy itself to have happened (3d already verified the health endpoint); driving it as `ace@<automation-account>` afterward is the same level of access. If you genuinely cannot reach the deployed app (broken auth, region outage, etc.), the cycle is in a stuck-state — Phase D's stuck-state branch applies.

### Deprecating `testing.dogfood.base_url` / `start_command` / `wait_for`

These fields existed for the old localhost-dogfood flow. They are not removed yet — existing configs validate as before — but new projects should leave them unset. A future canopy version will remove them entirely. The `headless_browser_skill` field stays; it now drives prod.

## 3d. Post-deploy health check

After deploy:

1. Poll each `shipping.post_deploy_health` URL with backoff (5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s — total ~5 min) for 200 OK
2. If any URL fails or stays 5xx: do NOT auto-revert. The broken-prod state becomes the next scout finding; switch into a fix-forward investigation cycle (still autonomous)
3. If still red after `guardrails.max_fix_forward_attempts` cycles: log "stuck" in the run log, send a minimal "no email this sprint, here's why" note via `email.sender_skill`, stop.
