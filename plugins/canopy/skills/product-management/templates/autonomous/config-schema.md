# autonomous.yaml — Schema and Example

This file lives at `.claude/pm/autonomous.yaml` for any project that adopts the autonomous mode of `canopy:product-management`. If it's missing on first run, Phase 0 of `cycle.md` **auto-bootstraps it from project signals** (git config, repo basename, deploy workflows in `.github/workflows/`, `pyproject.toml`/`package.json`, README health URLs, docker-compose presence) and continues without prompting. The user can edit the file later if any defaults are wrong; the skill never silently overwrites an already-existing config.

The skill is deliberately project-agnostic — every project-specific knob lives here.

## Required keys

| Key | Type | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| `email.to` | str | Recipient address (single user) |
| `email.from` | str | Sender address; must match the `sender_skill`'s configured account |
| `email.subject_prefix` | str | Wraps every release-notes subject, e.g. `[ace-web]` |
| `email.sender_skill` | str | Fully-qualified skill name — autonomous mode invokes this skill to send mail |
| `shipping.branch_prefix` | str | All autonomous PRs branch from this prefix, e.g. `ace-web/auto/` |
| `shipping.pr_label` | str | GitHub label applied to every autonomous PR (visibility) |
| `shipping.merge` | str | One of `squash`, `merge`, `rebase` |
| `shipping.deploy_command` | str | Shell command to trigger deploy after merge |
| `shipping.deploy_workflow` | str | Workflow filename, used to poll deploy status |
| `shipping.post_deploy_health` | list[str] | Non-empty list of URLs polled after deploy |
| `testing.unit` / `testing.lint` / `testing.types` | str | Mechanical-check commands run by the gate |
| `testing.dogfood.start_command` | str | Brings the local stack up |
| `testing.dogfood.wait_for` | str | URL polled until the stack is ready |
| `testing.dogfood.base_url` | str | Root URL the headless browser drives |
| `testing.dogfood.headless_browser_skill` | str | Skill name (`gstack`, `browse`, etc.) |
| `guardrails.one_pr_in_flight` | bool | Hardcoded `true` for v1; rejecting any other value is fine |
| `guardrails.diff_size_limit_lines` | int > 0 | Cap fed to `diff_size_check.py` |
| `guardrails.max_fix_forward_attempts` | int > 0 | After this many failed cycles on the same red signal, the sprint logs "stuck" and stops |
| `theme_detection.lens_rotation` | list[str] | Starting lenses for Phase A scout; the sprint is free to mix |

## Validation

Run the validator manually with:

```bash
PLUGIN_PATH=$(python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('$HOME/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json')); print(d['plugins']['canopy@canopy'][0]['installPath'])")
uv run --script "$PLUGIN_PATH/skills/product-management/scripts/validate_autonomous_config.py" .claude/pm/autonomous.yaml
```

The validator's YAML dependency is declared inline (PEP 723) so `uv run --script` resolves it on the fly. Plain `python3` will fail unless your system python already has PyYAML.

Phase 0 of `cycle.md` calls this script automatically.

## Canonical example (ace-web — for illustration; the actual file lives in the ace-web repo, not here)
