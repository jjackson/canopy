  Upload a converged DDD run's artifacts to canopy-web as ONE navigable package:
  upload the hero video, build a self-contained HTML docs page (hero video +
  capabilities + why + how for a prospective feature user), run the
  external_release review gate, then publish to canopy-web — where the video,
  deck, narrative, and links group under the run and are navigable at
  /ddd/<feature>/<run_id>. Returns the run PACKAGE URL, not a loose artifact link.
  Phase transitions from "converged" → "uploaded" on publish; no-op on hold.
  Use when asked to "upload this run", "publish the run", or "upload the run package".

## Preamble (run first)

```bash
_CANOPY_UPD=$(bash ~/emdash-projects/canopy/scripts/canopy-update-check.sh 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -n "$_CANOPY_UPD" ]; then echo "$_CANOPY_UPD"; fi
```

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: tell the user "canopy **v{new}** is available (you're on v{old}). Run `/canopy:update` to upgrade." Then continue — do not block on the upgrade.

# DDD Upload

Terminal step of the DDD loop: once a run has converged, UPLOAD its artifacts to
canopy-web so they package together under the run. The result is a single
navigable view — **`/ddd/<feature>/<run_id>`** — that links the run's hero
video, docs/deck, narrative, and companion links. The skill returns **that
package URL**, not a loose `/w/<artifact-id>` single-artifact link.

## How packaging works (why you get one navigable view, not loose links)

canopy-web groups artifacts by the `run_id`/`feature`/`role` fields sent on
every upload, and assembles them into a run package:

- **video** ← the hero video upload (`role=hero_video`)
- **deck** ← the docs HTML page this skill builds (`role=docs`)
- **narrative** ← the `ReviewRequest` posted under the **same `run_id`** by the
  earlier `ddd-narrative-review` gate. For the narrative to appear in the
  package, that gate must have run for this run_id (the orchestrator's normal
  flow ensures it). If you uploaded a run that never went through narrative
  review, the package's narrative slot will be empty — re-run the narrative gate
  for that run_id to populate it.
- **links** ← companion links unioned across the run's artifacts.

The package + previous-runs navigation live at `/ddd/<feature>` (narrative
landing) and `/ddd/<feature>/<run_id>` (the run package).

## Inputs

- **`run_id`** — an existing converged run identifier.  The run directory must
  already exist at `<ddd_dir>/runs/<run_id>/` and contain:
  - `run_state.yaml` (phase should be `converged`)
  - `unified_spec.yaml`
  - `why_brief.yaml`
- **`video_path`** — local filesystem path to the hero video `.mp4` produced by
  the converged walkthrough render step.

## What the docs page (deck) contains

The generated HTML is a **self-contained, no-external-deps documentation page**
aimed at a **prospective user of the feature** — not an internal reviewer, not a
developer.  Sections, in order:

1. **Hero video** at the top: the converged walkthrough recording embedded as a
   `<video>` (direct .mp4 / data URI) or `<iframe>` (canopy-web share page URLs
   containing `/w/`).
2. **What you can do** — one bullet per scene's `concept_claim`.  Capabilities.
3. **Why it works this way** — the `why_brief.problem` context followed by each
   `spine[].claim` + `spine[].rationale`.  Grounded reasoning.
4. **How to use it** — numbered steps from each scene's `show` field, in scene
   order.  Instructional.

All user-supplied text is HTML-escaped (no XSS).

> **Remotion glossy render is explicitly deferred.**  The current docs page is
> plain HTML — no Remotion, no ace-web, no MP4 generation from slides.  That
> upgrade is planned but out of scope here.

## Procedure

### Step 0 — Pre-flight: refuse partial runs

Read `<run_dir>/run_state.yaml`. If `scene_filter` is set (i.e. the
converged run came from `/canopy:ddd-run --scene <selector>`), STOP and
tell the user:

> "Run `<run_id>` was a partial render — it covered scenes <scenes_run>
> out of <spec_total>. Uploading requires a full-spec run so the
> published package reflects the whole feature, not just one scene.
> Re-run `/canopy:ddd-run <new_run_id> <unified_spec> <why_brief>`
> WITHOUT `--scene`, then upload that."

Do NOT attempt to assemble a docs page from a partial run, even if the
filtered scope converged — the "What you can do" section is built per
scene, and a partial run would publish a docs page missing capabilities
the spec promises.

### Step 1 — Run the upload script

Run the upload script (it lives in the canopy repo):

```bash
# scripts/ddd ships in the canopy repo, not the plugin cache — resolve it:
DDD_REPO="$HOME/emdash-projects/canopy"; [ -d "$DDD_REPO/scripts/ddd" ] || DDD_REPO="$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/canopy"
if [ ! -d "$DDD_REPO/scripts/ddd" ]; then echo "ERROR: scripts/ddd not found — run /canopy:update to sync the canopy checkout"; exit 1; fi
# pass the video_path as an absolute path (resolved before the cd):
VIDEO_ABS="$(realpath <video_path>)"
(cd "$DDD_REPO" && uv run python -m scripts.ddd.upload <run_id> --video "$VIDEO_ABS")
```

The script orchestrates all steps internally:

1. Loads `run_state.yaml` + `unified_spec.yaml` + `why_brief.yaml` from the run dir.
2. Uploads the hero video to canopy-web (`role=hero_video`) → `video_url`.
3. Builds the docs HTML via `build_docs_page(spec, why_brief, video_url)`.
4. Opens the **external_release** review gate (see below).
5. On `"publish"`: uploads the HTML (`role=docs`), sets `phase = "uploaded"`,
   saves, and returns the run **package** URL `/ddd/<feature>/<run_id>`.
6. On `"hold"`: returns without publishing the deck; phase stays unchanged.

### Step 2 — External release gate

The gate presents a `ReviewRequest` with:

```
gate: "external_release"
decisions:
  - id: publish
    prompt: "Publish this run package for users?"
    options: [publish, hold]
    recommended: publish
    class: external_release
```

The review is posted to canopy-web and the script waits for human resolution.

**Outcomes:**

| Decision | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `publish` | Deck HTML is uploaded, `phase = "uploaded"`, **package URL** is returned |
| `hold`    | No deck upload, phase unchanged, script exits with empty string |

If the human chose `hold`, tell the user:

```
Upload held — the run package was not published.
Review the hero video and the docs HTML preview, make any corrections, then
re-run /canopy:ddd-upload when ready.
```

### Step 3 — Report

On successful publish:

```
DDD Upload — <run_id>
══════════════════════════════════════
  Run dir: <run_dir>

  Package:  <package_url>     ← /ddd/<feature>/<run_id> (navigable: video · deck · narrative · links)

  phase → uploaded
```

Tell the user: "Run uploaded. Share `<package_url>` — it's the navigable
package (video, deck, narrative, and links) for this run."

## Output artefacts

| Artefact | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `run_state.yaml` (phase=uploaded) | Written on successful publish only |
| Run package on canopy-web | `/ddd/<feature>/<run_id>` — groups video + deck + narrative + links |
| Docs page (deck) on canopy-web | Self-contained HTML; grouped under the run via `role=docs` |
| Hero video on canopy-web | Uploaded first (`role=hero_video`); embedded in the deck and the package |
