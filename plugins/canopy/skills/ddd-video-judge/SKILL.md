  Multimodal LLM judge for a RENDERED connect-ddd-walkthrough video — the
  audio-visual-timing counterpart to the screenshot concept judge. The concept/
  visual judge scores per-scene screenshots of the LIVE app and never opens the
  mp4, so VO↔visual coherence, pacing, and motion are invisible to it. This judge
  WATCHES the produced video: a frame is grabbed at the instant the voiceover
  speaks each named field, plus pacing frames across each scene, and a fresh
  per-scene multimodal pass scores whether the screen shows what's being said and
  whether it flows well. Use after rendering (report-only) to get a verdict-video
  with findings routed to NARRATION / FOOTAGE / PRODUCT / RENDER.

# DDD video judge (multimodal, rendered-video)

## Why — the gap this fills

`canopy:ddd-concept-eval` scores **screenshots of the live app** for concept
soundness and never opens the produced mp4. `canopy:ddd-timing-eval` scores
field↔word sync **deterministically** (does a named field's cursor arrive on its
word) but can't judge *semantics* (does the screen actually SHOW what's narrated)
or *feel* (pacing, motion jank). This judge is the multimodal layer: it watches
the rendered video and scores what only a viewer can.

It is **report-only** by default — a render-path verdict, parallel to the
screenshot loop. Run it on demand; do NOT gate the fast product loop on it.

## Pipeline

```
output.mp4 + beat-timeline.json + VO alignments
        │  scripts/ddd/video_judge.py  (harness)
        ▼
per-scene montages (VO-word-mark frames + pacing frames) + manifest.json
        │  per-scene multimodal judge pass (this skill)
        ▼
verdict-video.json  (per-scene scores + routed findings)
```

## Step 1 — build the evidence packets

```bash
# run_dir holds output.mp4 + beat-timeline.json (render.ts writes both)
python3 -m scripts.ddd.video_judge <run_dir> <explainer_spec.(json|yaml)> <audio_dir> <out_dir>
```
Each scene gets `<beat>_montage.png` (frames labelled with the spoken word / pacing
%) and a `manifest.json` row (narration, the word→time→field list, window).

## Step 2 — judge each scene (fresh context per scene = Tough Judge)

For EACH scene, dispatch a subagent whose context contains ONLY that scene's
montage + manifest row + the rubric below — no build history, no other scenes
(cross-contamination inflates scores). Score 1–5 per dimension; default to 3 and
move up/down only with evidence from the frames.

**Rubric (weakest-link overall):**
- `vo_visual_coherence` (.35) — at each VO-word-mark frame, does the screen show
  the field/thing being spoken? A frame where the VO says "contact" but the screen
  is on a different field is the core defect.
- `pacing` (.25) — across the pacing frames, is the scene comprehensible — not
  fast-forward-blurred, not frozen-and-dead?
- `motion_quality` (.20) — smooth playback vs visible jank / unnatural speed-ramps
  from the time-warp.
- `narration_fit` (.20) — does the narration match what's shown (no long frozen
  tail with VO still talking; no rushed cram)?

**Findings** — each carries a `route`:
- `NARRATION` — reword/reorder/trim the scene's `narrative` (most VO↔visual misses
  are narration naming things in a different order than the demo shows them).
- `FOOTAGE` — re-record / add demo footage (footage too short for the narration).
- `PRODUCT` — a UI moment that's confusing IN MOTION (a real app finding the
  screenshot judge missed — route it back to the product loop).
- `RENDER` — an engine artifact (bad warp ramp, clipped audio).

Return per scene: `{beat, scores:{...}, overall, verdict: pass|warn|fail, findings:[{route, text}]}`.

## Step 3 — assemble + report

Aggregate to `verdict-video.json` (overall = mean of per-scene overalls; verdict =
worst scene's verdict). Surface NARRATION/FOOTAGE findings to the video-improvement
loop; surface PRODUCT findings back to the product loop (the bonus — this judge is
a second lens on the app, not just the video).

## Relationship to other evals
- `canopy:ddd-timing-eval` — the cheap deterministic gate; run it first and only
  spend multimodal tokens here when it (and the render's overrun line) pass a floor.
- `canopy:ddd-concept-eval` — concept soundness from screenshots; orthogonal.
- `canopy:visual-judge` — the per-screenshot Tough Judge; this reuses its
  methodology over a temporal frame-strip instead of one frame.
