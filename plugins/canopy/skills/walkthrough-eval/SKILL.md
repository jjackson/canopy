# Walkthrough Eval

Run the walkthrough skill against test fixtures with planted defects. Compare
the walkthrough's scores against human-calibrated ground truth to measure
scoring accuracy, defect detection, and routing correctness. Track metrics
over time to measure whether prompt changes improve the walkthrough.

## Modes

- `/walkthrough-eval run` — Run all fixtures, report metrics
- `/walkthrough-eval run <fixture>` — Run a single fixture
- `/walkthrough-eval history` — Show metric trends over time
- `/walkthrough-eval compare <r1> <r2>` — Side-by-side comparison of two runs
- `/walkthrough-eval consistency <fixture>` — Run same fixture 3x, measure variance

## Setup

### Locate fixtures

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
EVAL_DIR=""
for P in \
  "$_ROOT/evals/walkthrough" \
  ~/emdash-projects/canopy/evals/walkthrough \
  ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/canopy/evals/walkthrough; do
  [ -d "$P/fixtures" ] && EVAL_DIR="$P" && break
done
echo "${EVAL_DIR:-NOT_FOUND}"
```

If NOT_FOUND, tell the user to run `/walkthrough-defect-creator <name>` first
to generate fixtures.

### List available fixtures

```bash
ls -d "$EVAL_DIR/fixtures"/*/ 2>/dev/null | xargs -I{} basename {}
```

### Determine run version

```bash
mkdir -p "$EVAL_DIR/eval-runs"
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
LATEST=$(ls -d "$EVAL_DIR/eval-runs/$TODAY-v"* 2>/dev/null | sort | tail -1)
if [ -z "$LATEST" ]; then
  RUN_ID="$TODAY-v001"
else
  NUM=$(echo "$LATEST" | grep -o 'v[0-9]*$' | tr -d 'v')
  NEXT=$(printf "v%03d" $((10#$NUM + 1)))
  RUN_ID="$TODAY-$NEXT"
fi
RUN_DIR="$EVAL_DIR/eval-runs/$RUN_ID"
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"
echo "Run: $RUN_ID → $RUN_DIR"
```

## Run Mode

For each fixture (or a single fixture if specified):

### Step 1: Serve the fixture

```bash
cd "$EVAL_DIR/fixtures/<fixture>"
python3 -m http.server 0 &
SERVER_PID=$!
sleep 1
```

Parse the port from the server output. The server prints
`Serving HTTP on :: port NNNNN`. Extract the port number.

### Step 2: Prepare the walkthrough spec

Read the fixture's `spec.yaml`. Replace `{{PORT}}` with the actual port.
Write the resolved spec to a temp file:

```bash
RESOLVED_SPEC="/tmp/walkthrough-eval-spec-<fixture>.yaml"
sed "s/{{PORT}}/$PORT/g" "$EVAL_DIR/fixtures/<fixture>/spec.yaml" > "$RESOLVED_SPEC"
```

Also create the required `docs/walkthroughs/` directory structure so the
walkthrough skill can find the spec:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/walkthrough-eval-project/docs/walkthroughs
cp "$RESOLVED_SPEC" /tmp/walkthrough-eval-project/docs/walkthroughs/<fixture>.yaml
mkdir -p /tmp/walkthrough-eval-project/screenshots/walkthroughs
```

### Step 3: Run the walkthrough skill

Invoke the walkthrough skill against this fixture. The key constraint: you
need the walkthrough to produce its standard JSON sidecar output so we can
extract scores.

Use the Skill tool to invoke `/walkthrough <fixture>`. Point it at the
resolved spec. The walkthrough will:
- Set up browse
- Execute all scenes against `localhost:<port>`
- Score on 5 dimensions
- Write JSON sidecar to `/tmp/walkthrough-run-data.json`

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT run the walkthrough in improve mode. Run it in plain
`run` mode only — we want raw scores, not the improvement loop.

After the walkthrough completes, read the JSON sidecar:

```bash
cat /tmp/walkthrough-run-data.json
```

### Step 4: Kill the server

```bash
kill $SERVER_PID 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 5: Extract scores

Parse the JSON sidecar. For each scene slide, extract:
- The 5-dimension scores from `ai_evaluation.commentary`
- The overall score from `ai_evaluation.score`
- Any issues from the summary slide

The commentary format is:
```
Overall: 3/5 (weakest: Content). A: Content 3/5 — generic. B: App Page 4/5 — clean. C: Screenshot 4/5 — good. D: Slide 4/5 — clear. E: Demo Ready 3/5 — needs polish.
```

Parse each dimension score from this string.

### Step 6: Compare against ground truth

Read `$EVAL_DIR/fixtures/<fixture>/ground-truth.json`.

**Calibration:** For each scene × dimension, check if the walkthrough's score
falls within the expected `[min, max]` range.

```
Score: 2, Expected: [1, 2] → HIT
Score: 4, Expected: [1, 2] → MISS (walkthrough scored too high — missed the defect)
Score: 1, Expected: [4, 5] → MISS (walkthrough scored too low — false alarm)
```

Count hits and misses. Calibration accuracy = hits / total.

**Detection:** For each item in `expected_detections`, search the walkthrough's
commentary, issues list, and "worst thing found" quotes for the `match_hint`
string (case-insensitive substring match). If found, the defect was detected.

Detection rate = found / planted.

**Severity accuracy:** For each detected defect, check if the walkthrough
attributed it to the correct `dimension`. Look at which dimension scored
lowest for the relevant scene — if it matches the expected dimension, it's
correct.

Severity accuracy = correct / detected.

**Routing accuracy:** If `expected_routing` exists in ground truth, check the
walkthrough's action list (the "Fix:" lines in scene scoring output). Map
fix categories to specialist skills:
- `[CODE]` on content issues → `/review` (expected_routing.review)
- `[CODE]` on styling issues → `/design-review` (expected_routing.design_review)
- `[CODE]` or `[INFRA]` on readiness issues → `/qa` (expected_routing.qa)

If the walkthrough recommended the right specialist for the right dimension
failure, the routing is correct.

Routing accuracy = correct / total decisions.

### Step 7: Save fixture results

```bash
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR/fixtures/<fixture>"
```

Save:
- `sidecar.json` — copy of `/tmp/walkthrough-run-data.json`
- `screenshots/` — copy of walkthrough screenshots

### Step 8: Aggregate and report (after all fixtures)

After running all fixtures, compute aggregate metrics:

| Metric | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Calibration accuracy | 0.35 |
| Detection rate | 0.30 |
| Severity accuracy | 0.15 |
| Routing accuracy | 0.20 |

Composite = weighted average.

Write `results.json` to `$RUN_DIR/`:

```json
{
  "run_id": "<RUN_ID>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "walkthrough_skill_sha": "<git SHA of SKILL.md>",
  "fixtures": {
    "<fixture-name>": {
      "calibration": {"hits": 5, "total": 5, "accuracy": 1.0},
      "detection": {"found": 0, "planted": 0, "rate": null},
      "severity": {"correct": 0, "total": 0, "accuracy": null},
      "routing": {"correct": 0, "total": 0, "accuracy": null},
      "raw_scores": {
        "scene_1": {"content": 4, "app_page": 5, "screenshot": 4, "slide": 4, "demo_readiness": 5}
      }
    }
  },
  "aggregate": {
    "calibration": 0.84,
    "detection": 0.85,
    "severity": 0.91,
    "routing": 0.83,
    "composite": 0.85
  }
}
```

For metrics with no applicable data (e.g., detection rate for the clean fixture
which has 0 planted defects), use `null` and exclude from aggregation.

### Step 9: Update history

Append to `$EVAL_DIR/eval-history.json`:

```json
{
  "run_id": "<RUN_ID>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "walkthrough_skill_sha": "<SHA>",
  "composite": 0.85,
  "calibration": 0.84,
  "detection": 0.85,
  "severity": 0.91,
  "routing": 0.83,
  "fixture_count": 5
}
```

If the file doesn't exist, create it as `[]` first.

### Step 10: Print report

```

Composite: 0.85
```

If a previous run exists in eval-history.json, also show:
```
vs previous: +0.07 (was 0.78)
Trend: improving / stable / regressing
```

## History Mode

Read `$EVAL_DIR/eval-history.json` and display:

```
Walkthrough Eval History
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Run              Composite  Calibr.  Detect.  Severity  Routing
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2026-03-26-v001    0.78      80%      75%      85%      80%
2026-03-26-v002    0.82      84%      80%      88%      80%

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Trend: improving (+0.07 over 3 runs)
Best: 2026-03-27-v001 (0.85)
```

## Compare Mode

Load two runs' `results.json`, show per-fixture comparison:

```
Comparing <r1> vs <r2>
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Fixture              <r1> Comp.  <r2> Comp.  Delta
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OVERALL               0.78       0.82       +0.04  ▲
```

## Consistency Mode

Run the specified fixture 3 times. For each dimension across all scenes,
compute the standard deviation of scores.

```
Consistency Check — <fixture> (3 runs)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Dimension        Run 1  Run 2  Run 3  StdDev   Status
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Content           2      2      3     0.47     STABLE
App Page          4      4      4     0.00     STABLE
Screenshot        4      3      4     0.47     STABLE
Slide             3      4      3     0.47     STABLE
Demo Readiness    2      2      2     0.00     STABLE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Overall: STABLE (all dimensions stddev ≤ 0.5)
```

If any dimension has stddev > 0.5, flag it as NOISY — the scoring prompt
needs tightening for that dimension.
